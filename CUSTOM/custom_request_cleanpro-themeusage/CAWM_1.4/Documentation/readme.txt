* Updated to version 1.1 for MyBB 1.8.x usage by Vintagedaddyo

* Updated to version 1.2 for MyBB 1.8.x usage by Vintagedaddyo

-modified marquee slightly
-added options to display on index or portal and select either on or off

* 1.3 further localization

* 1.4 variant: a customized version simply done up for a specific user wanting a news ticker and such to work with clean-pro theme ** note I only included English and englishgb localization in this variant as my time was limited and existing plugin localizations from 1.3 would need to modified for additional settings and text changes I made
